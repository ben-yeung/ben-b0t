## Discord Bot written in JavaScript using discord.js
This project began Fall 2020 and was published to a public repo on 04/24/21


## ðŸ¤– A simple, personalized Discord Bot to interact, moderate, and log a Discord server. 

Overall a very interactive project that allowed me to learn more about Data Structures, string manipulation, OAuth Flows, and parsing I/O.
Originally an single file full of if statements, this repo publication is a cleaner and more organized version with a command handler.

## ðŸ‘¾ Over 30+ Commands ranging from moderation, fun, and information.
* ðŸš¨ **Moderation**: `ban`, `kick`, `mute`, `modclear`, `clearb0t`, `shutdown`, and more
* ðŸŽŠ **Fun**: `dog`, `cat`, `ascii`, `8ball`, `fliptext`, `ytsearch`, and more
* ðŸ”Ž **Search**: `define`, `syn`, `translate`, `find [Google Image Search]`, and more
* ðŸ“Š **Information**: `covid`, `weather`, `poll`, `uptime`, `remind`, `decide`, and more


## ðŸ“º Twitch API Integration
* Client Credentials OAuth Flow
* Return information about a given streamer username with the `twitch [username]` command.
* Options to setup a CronJob to automatically send Twitch clips of a given streamer to a Discord channel.
  * Do note that this command is used and tested on a smaller channel.
  * There is no spam prevention and thus any clips within the past day are sent automatically to a given channel.

## ðŸ§° Debugging / Notes
* Note that some commands may use the `quick.db` package 
 * Trying to deploy with services such as Heroku may not support long term storage that quick.db may need
 * Check with the provider FAQs to see if there is an alternative approach
* The help command excludes some moderation / bot config commands from general public access; adjust as necessary
* Some moderation commands may become deprecated as Discord.js changes
